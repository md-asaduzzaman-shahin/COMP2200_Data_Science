# Reflective Report on Portfolio 4

## Process of Solving Problems and Learning to Use Notebooks

At the beginning of the unit, I had limited experience with data analysis and machine learning. However, through the course materials, weekly practicals, and the portfolio assignments, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in these areas.

The process of solving problems in Portfolio 4 involved several steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: I started by understanding the structure of the Uber rides dataset, identifying the variables, and checking for missing values or outliers.

2. **Data Cleaning**: I handled missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing them, depending on the context. I also removed outliers that could potentially skew the analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I performed EDA to gain insights into the data, such as the distribution of miles traveled, the relationship between variables, and identifying patterns or trends.

4. **Feature Selection**: I used techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most relevant features for predicting the miles traveled.

5. **Model Building**: I experimented with different machine learning models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, random forest, and K-means clustering, to solve various problems related to the dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**: I evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy and F1-score, to assess their effectiveness in solving the given problems.

Throughout this process, I learned to use Jupyter Notebooks effectively for data analysis and machine learning tasks. Notebooks allowed me to combine code, visualizations, and explanations in a single document, making it easier to document and share my work.

## Progression and Future Interests

From the start of the unit until now, I have made significant progress in understanding and applying data analysis and machine learning techniques. Initially, I had a basic understanding of these concepts, but through hands-on practice and the portfolio assignments, I have gained practical experience in working with real-world datasets.

One area that particularly interests me is the application of machine learning in predictive analytics. I find it fascinating how algorithms can learn from data and make accurate predictions, which can be valuable in various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.

In the future, I would like to explore more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and natural language processing. Additionally, I am interested in learning about deploying machine learning models in production environments and integrating them into applications or decision-making processes.

## Discussion Points

### 1. Choice of Dataset

I chose the 'My Uber Drives - 2016' dataset for Portfolio 4 because it provided an opportunity to analyze real-world data from a popular ride-sharing service. The dataset contained various features, such as start and end dates, locations, miles traveled, and ride purposes, which allowed for a comprehensive analysis.

Additionally, the dataset covered an entire year, enabling me to explore seasonal patterns and trends in ride demand. Understanding these patterns can be valuable for businesses like Uber to optimize their operations and resource allocation.

### 2. Suitability of Machine Learning Models

In Portfolio 4, I employed several machine learning models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, random forest, and K-means clustering. The choice of these models was based on the specific problems I aimed to solve and the nature of the data.

For predicting the miles traveled, which is a continuous variable, I used linear regression and polynomial regression models. These models are suitable for regression problems where the goal is to predict a numerical value based on input features.

For predicting the ride category (Business or Personal), which is a binary classification problem, I used logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Logistic regression is a popular choice for binary classification, while random forest is an ensemble method that can handle complex relationships and non-linear data.

Additionally, I employed K-means clustering to explore potential groupings or patterns within the dataset based on the ride characteristics. Clustering algorithms can be useful for identifying underlying structures or segments in the data without relying on labeled data.

The selection of these models was driven by their suitability for the specific problems at hand and their ability to capture the relationships between the input features and the target variables effectively.

## Conclusion

Through Portfolio 4, I have gained practical experience in data analysis, feature selection, and applying various machine learning models to solve real-world problems. The process of solving these problems and learning to use Jupyter Notebooks has been invaluable in enhancing my skills and understanding of these concepts.

Moving forward, I am excited to continue exploring advanced machine learning techniques and their applications in various domains. The knowledge and experience gained from this unit will serve as a solid foundation for further growth and exploration in the field of data science and machine learning.
