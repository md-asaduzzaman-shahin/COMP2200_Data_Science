# Mobile Price Prediction Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains my portfolio work for the course "Analysis of Mobile Price Data" in the 2024 S1 semester. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models for classifying mobile phone price ranges based on various hardware specifications and features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the 'Mobile Price Data' dataset, which contains information about mobile phone hardware, specifications, and prices. The dataset includes features such as battery power, clock speed, camera megapixels, memory, screen size, and more. The target variable is 'price range', which is a categorical variable with values 0 (low cost), 1 (medium cost), 2 (high cost), and 3 (very high cost).

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset file `My Uber Drives - 2016.csv`.
- `notebook/`: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook `48225320_Portfolio 4.ipynb` with the code for data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Analysis Steps

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Explore the dataset**: Understand the structure, data types, and missing values in the dataset.
2. **Data cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and preprocess the data as needed.
3. **Descriptive statistics**: Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for relevant variables.
4. **Data visualization**: Create visualizations to represent the distribution of miles traveled, the relationship between variables, and other relevant insights.
5. **Analyze the data**: Perform additional analyses based on the insights gained from the previous steps.
