    "\n",
    "**Reproducibility** is an increasingly important goal in Science and Data Science is playing a big role in helping to achieve it.  Scientists are concerned that many published studies could not be repeated by other groups because of this (see [Replication Crisis on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)).  Part of the response is an increased awareness of the need to make research data openly available and to publish the software and methods that was used to generate the results. See [Open Science Foundation](https://osf.io), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [Figshare](https://figshare.com) as examples of services that have been established to help scientists share research data and software.\n"

You'll see how it enables us to create a single document that contains both the commentary on the data and analysis and the code that generates the results.  Sharing a notebook as part of the product of your research can enhance the reproducibility of your work, which makes it better science. \n"
